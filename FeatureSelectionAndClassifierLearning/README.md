# Project stage 2 report and presentation requirements:

## 1. Report should be formally organized, formatted, and written without spelling errors.

Report should clearly describe the problem you address, and particularly how you
address the problem step by step with details (e.g. how you finalize the vocabulary,
what model you use to implement the classifier, what is the performance, what you
have done to improve the performance).

## 2. You should implement your own code without using any open sources.

## 3. Provide references at the end of report for any work you refer to.

## 4. Report and presentation should address the following:
### 1) Feature selection

o The vocabulary you actually use in the implementation of the classifier:
the size and all words

o How you reduce the vocabulary from stage 1 to this size, and why you
are confident these words are good in discrimination

o Review the key parts of your code

### 2) Classifier learning

o What classifier model you have chosen and implemented

o What is the performance

o What you have done to improve the performance

o Review the key parts of your code

### 3) Any lessons you have learned and deemed valuable. Note: Discussion on
lessons and problems won't impact your marks negatively but positively.

### 4) The presentation slides should be readable to audiences with proper fonts.

## 5. Report and presentation should be printed out and submitted to me before the due day class.
